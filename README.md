# Capstone2

This repository contains my second capstone project for my Springboard course. The datasets are gathered from a Kaggle competition where, given some geographic, demographic, and mobile phone usage data, the goal is to predict the mobile users' gender and age groups. In the notebook, you will find various analyses and visualizations of the data. The chosen classification model is the Random Forest Classifier.

Files important to this project include:
- app_events.csv
- events.csv
- gender_age_train.csv
- phone_brand_device_model.csv

The following materials can be found in this repository:
- The CSV files from the Kaggle competition
- Data wrangling portion of my capstone
- Data story telling portion of my capstone
- Inferential statistics portion of my capstone
- Machine Learning portion of my capstone
- Capstone slides (PPT)
- Project reports
- Complete code of capstone

**Note:** Currently, the RFC model's performance is not ideal. This project will be revisted. I currently, as of January 2019, do not have enough knowledge in text mining or Natural Language Processing (NLP) to effectively process and make use of the 900+ unique mobile app categories in this dataset. I believe analyzing the common types/categories of apps each gender/age group has installed on their devices will strengthen the model's performance.
